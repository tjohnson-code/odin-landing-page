# odin-landing-page

## 1/22/22 - Start of project
This is the start of my Landing Page project for The Odin Project.
I'm going to start by trying to mimic the basic landing page html and styles.
After I like the layout - I will try to add my own spin on it.

## 2/7/22 - Finished project
Here is my finished landing page. I meant to update this README as I went, but I ended up too focused on getting the coding right. I like the way the layout turned out, and I will come back to this, to add real links/make it accessible to mobile, later on.
